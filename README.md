#  Vue.js Web Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio created with Vue.js. Here's how to install the project:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/your_username/my-vue-portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command `cd vuejs-web-portfolio`
3. Install dependencies using the command `npm install`

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the project using the command `npm run serve`. This will launch a development server at http://localhost:8080/ where you can view your portfolio.

## Customization

You can customize the content of your portfolio by modifying files in the `src/` directory. The `App.vue` and `main.js` files are the main application files, while the `components/` directory contains reusable components.

## Deployment

To deploy your portfolio to a server, you can build the project using the command `npm run build`. This will create a `dist/` directory containing production-optimized files. You can then deploy the files in the `dist/` directory to your server.
